# Get Started

## Introduction

**Windsurf** is more than just a code editor — it’s the *agentic IDE* built for real collaboration between developers and AI.  
Its built-in agent, **Cascade**, understands your entire project, works across files, remembers context, and follows rules you set.

Instead of just autocompleting, Windsurf helps plan, refactor, and execute complex workflows — turning ideas into working code faster.  
It’s a tool designed to make developers more **productive**, **creative**, and **future-ready**.
