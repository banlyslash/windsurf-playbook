# Stuff You Should Know

Did you know that:
- **Cascade memory** fades over time, making early context blur! To refresh that context, it's highly recommended to ask Cascade to clarify relevant content before embarking on any major changes, like a naming convention migration.
- You can **export conversations** as markdown using the `Download Trajectory` option in the Cascade action menu! It's a handy way to keep track of your discussions.
- **Generating documentation can be a resource hog**! It's wise to enforce some rules to prevent unnecessary text generation and save on costs.
- **Multiple Windsurf Windows**? Not the best idea! They can confuse Windsurf and lead to unexpected hiccups, like being unable to edit files.
- **Model Selection** is crucial! Using an expensive model can quickly drain your credits, so choose wisely!
- You can **Drag and Drop** to @-mention a file or folder! Typing mentions can be finicky at times, so this feature will save you some trouble.
- **Local Indexing** for a new workspace can lead to initial slowness, as Windsurf requires approximately 5 to 10 minutes to index the entire codebase before you can fully utilize its features.
- **Switching models** can cause context loss! The new model won't inherit the full conversation history or context from the previous one, so you may need to restate key information.
