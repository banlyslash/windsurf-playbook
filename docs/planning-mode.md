# Windsurf Planning Mode: Quick Start Guide

## Introduction
Planning Mode in Windsurf Cascade is a powerful feature that enhances productivity for complex, multi-step tasks. It provides a specialized planning agent that continuously refines long-term plans while your selected AI model focuses on executing short-term actions. Instead of creating a separate markdown file, Planning Mode creates an interactive Todo list within the conversation, making it easy to track progress and adjust plans as needed.

## Feature Settings
- **Activation**: Planning Mode is enabled by default; toggle it using the button below the Cascade input box
- **Todo Lists**: Cascade creates and maintains a structured Todo list within the conversation
- **Automatic Updates**: The system automatically updates the plan as it discovers new information
- **Collaborative Editing**: You can ask Cascade to update the plan or modify it yourself
- **Persistent Context**: The plan provides consistent context throughout long, complex tasks

## Do's for Code Quality
- Use Planning Mode for complex, multi-step development tasks
- Break down large features into smaller, manageable tasks
- Include code quality checks as explicit steps in your plan
- Update the plan when requirements or understanding changes
- Reference the plan regularly to ensure consistent implementation
- Include testing steps for each major feature component
- Document architectural decisions in the plan for future reference

## Don'ts for Code Quality
- Don't skip planning for complex features or refactorings
- Avoid overly detailed plans that become rigid and hard to adapt
- Don't leave code quality checks until the end of the plan
- Avoid creating plans without clear acceptance criteria
- Don't ignore plan updates when new information emerges
- Avoid creating plans that don't include testing steps
- Don't use Planning Mode for simple, straightforward tasks

## Tips
- Start with a high-level plan and let Cascade refine it
- Ask Cascade to update the plan when requirements change
- Use the plan to track progress and identify bottlenecks
- Include code review steps at logical checkpoints
- Reference the plan when resuming work after interruptions
- Use checkpoints to mark significant milestones
- Combine Planning Mode with Memories for maximum effectiveness
